 * Strategy used for verification. It takes an arbitrary strategy, and converts it to a piecewise
 * constant one on a grid. The grid is spaced closer together for high valuations, as controlled 
 * by a factor in (0,1): the highest and second-highest grid points are spaced factor*avg apart from 
 * each other, where avg is the distance they would be apart on a regular grid.
 * 
 * This is the implementation in one dimension.
